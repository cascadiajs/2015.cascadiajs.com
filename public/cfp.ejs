        <p>Cascadia JSFest 2015 is July 8th, 9th, and 10th at the Semiahmoo Resort in Blaine, Washington; and
        we'd love for you to be a part of it! Each day is organized around a
        theme. Share your expertise with the Cascadia community on:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>CSS Day</li>
          <li>BrowserJS Day</li>
          <li>ServerJS Day</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The entire event is Cascadia JSFest and we're stoked that you're
        considering contributing to the fun!</p>

        <p>We invite the CSS and JavaScript community to submit talks for CJSFest
        2015 at the Semiahmoo Resort in Washington. This Call for Proposals will
        close on March 15th. Diversity of voices is important to our community,
        so please don't think that you need to be a programming celebrity in
        order to speak at CJSFest 2015. <strong class="blue">The deadline to submit a proposal is
        March 15, 2015 11:59pm UTC-1200</strong>. If it's still March 15th, no matter
        where you are in the world, you still have time! When youâ€™re ready to
        submit a proposal, read the
        <a href="https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/proposals/README.md">instructions on GitHub</a> to get started.</p>

        <p>You are free to submit (and even revise) proposals up until the
        deadline. Our reviewers will be offering feedback for those ambitious
        enough to get their talks submitted earlier. Please help us spread the word!</p>
