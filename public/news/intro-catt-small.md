#Introducing Catt Small

Is this your first trip to the Pacific Northwest? Do you have other plans for your trip?
> I used to work at a company that was partially based in Seattle so I've been there a few times. I'm boring so I won't be doing much else except maybe working on some personal projects and enjoying the sun!

What does your usual work day look like?
> My days heavily vary, but usually it's some combination of research, sketching, designing, and building/prototyping. Whether I'm designing a product or making a game, I have a pretty similar way of working! I spend a lot of time testing and tweaking my work, then reviewing the results to figure out next steps. Then, I tweak things some more until my work is done.

Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?
> Allison House, hands down. I want to be like her when I grow up!

Have you worked in industries other than the web?
> I've worked for a graphic design agency as well as a mobile app company, but most of my work has been in the realm of web. I also do a lot of game development for fun, so sometimes I get invited to industry conferences and I know a lot of people in that industry.

What does your dream job look like?
> Waking up after 10AM, enjoying fresh air and sun for a few hours, then working on designing and building interactive programs. Watching people use the things I make. Working when I feel most productive rather than when it's light outside.

Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?
> I draw comics and sing at karaoke. People who karaoke with me have said I do a pretty good screamo voice, so I guess a rock band is in my future.

Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?
> I have a cat named Gato, which is Spanish for cat.
