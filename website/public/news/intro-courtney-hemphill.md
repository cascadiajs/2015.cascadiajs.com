Courtney Hemphill, partner & developer at Carbon Five, will show us simple ways to add functional animation to your interfaces with just a bit of JavaScript at CascadiaJS Browser Day. She's kindly agreed to answer a few of our introductory questions:

*Do you have other plans for your trip to the Pacific Northwest?*
> Visiting friends in Portland or if the weather is good, Smith Rocks to try and clean up some projects...

*What does your usual work day look like?*
> A flurry of standup meetings in the mornings followed by making a cappuccino on our lovely little Alex Duetto. I don't get to code much these days so I take the chance when I get it. Mostly I'm advising existing and new clients on their products and exploring best practices for developing and testing. Every now and again we take a long power lunch and go to Dogpatch for bouldering :)

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*
> On the development front, my friend [Kimon Tsinteris](http://kimtsi.com/). As a thinker on developers and our industry, [Evan Miller](http://www.evanmiller.org/). On the design side I think our team does some pretty awesome work and I'm constantly inspired by them but I have always learned so much from our friends at the d.school at Stanford too.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*
> I was a vet tech for a while and did a very brief stint in marine biology research. I took off 2 years to rock climb but that most assuredly does not count as "work".

*What does your dream job look like?*
> Kinda like my work now... maybe with a bit less schedule overload.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*
> Most all of my time is spent climbing. Mostly Yosemite. Formerly bouldering and most recently trad climbing. Just got back from Suirana. Bliss.

*Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?*
> I have an awesome Rhodesian Ridgeback named Lilli. If I could, I would bring her with me to the conference.
