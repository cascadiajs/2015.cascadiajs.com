Allen Pike runs Steamclock Software in Vancouver. His talk is about the causes and consequences of JavaScriptâ€™s turbulent framework ecosystem. Allen has answered some questions for us:

*As a Cascadian, what's your favorite local activity?*
> We're spoiled for choice. I do some hiking, biking, and skiing, but my favourite is simply walking the Seawall here in Vancouver on a sunny day. Despite rumours to the contrary, we do indeed have sunny days here.

*What does your usual work day look like?*
> I wear enough hats that every day is an unusual work day, which is the way I like it. Depending on the day, I do a mix of design, client meetings, support, project management, coding, and the random stuff that it takes to keep a software studio shipping good stuff.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*
> The fine folks at &yet. They're always experimenting, always learning, and always thinking about the people.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*
> Not really. My first job I was hired to do customer support at an ISP, but before long I was developing their intranet. My second job I was hired to do QA on a Palm OS app, but before long I was developing web apps there. My third job I was hired to build web apps, though I did end up doing a lot of native iOS development. And now at Steamclock, we do both web and native apps. The web has always been part of my work life, and I don't see that stopping any time soon.

*What does your dream job look like?*
> That's a deep question when you run your own studio, since in theory I should have my dream job - I created it myself, right? The more companies you work with and the more people in the industry you meet, you start to see every potential job as a set of tradeoffs and challenges, and the idea of a perfect job kind of fades away. That said, I get an extreme amount of enjoyment out of shipping great new products. The more we're doing that, the more it feels like a dream job.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*
> I play guitar, do theatre, and play on a hockey team of programmers. I also have a lot of little side projects that aren't my job but do to some degree require computers, like podcasting, running meetups, writing, teaching, and collecting endorsements on LinkedIn for "HTML7".

*Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?*
> One time when I was a kid, I made a game in BASIC that eventually would no longer run because QBASIC didn't allow more than 100KB of code in a function.
