            <p>CascadiaCSS 2015 is July 8th, at the <a href="/#venue">Semiahmoo Resort in Blaine, Washington</a>; and
            we'd love for you to be a part of it!</p>

            <p>The entire event is Cascadia JSFest and we're stoked that you're
            considering contributing to the fun!</p>

            <p>We invite the CSS community to submit talks for CJSFest
            2015 at the Semiahmoo Resort in Washington. This Call for Proposals will
            close on March 15th. Diversity of voices is important to our community,
            so please don't think that you need to be a programming celebrity in
            order to speak at CJSFest 2015. <strong class="blue">The deadline to submit a proposal is
            March 15, 2015 11:59pm UTC-1200</strong>. If it's still March 15th, no matter
            where you are in the world, you still have time! When youâ€™re ready to
            submit a proposal, read the
            <a href="https://github.com/cascadiajs/2015.cascadiajs.com/blob/master/proposals/README.md">instructions on GitHub</a> to get started.</p>

            <p>You are free to submit (and even revise) proposals up until the
            deadline. Our reviewers will be offering feedback for those ambitious
            enough to get their talks submitted earlier. Please help us spread the word!</p>
