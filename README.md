## New Structure

This year we are going to experiment with a new format for CascadiaFest. In the past CascadiaJS was a 2-day, 1-track conference that covered the gamut of JavaScript. In 2015, we are going to break down the event into 3 distinct days:

* CascadiaCSS
* CascadiaJS - BrowserJS
* CascadiaJS - ServerJS

The entire event will be called CascadiaFest and will share infrastructure such as the event space, hotel, etc. As an attendee you'll have the option of purchasing a ticket to a single event or a bundle that includes entry to all of them. All-access tickets will be a priority in release and single events and lodging days will be announced closer to the event.
