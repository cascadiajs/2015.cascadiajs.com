      >> If you're attending a workshop, you can find these those on the schedule on the website, so that's where you would go to do that.  Hopefully you're sticking around with us.  So I have a really important question for you.
      >> Okay.
      >> I love this talk.  This talk was everything, everything that I try to explain to developers all the time about focusing on small details.  When people write -- when we write a ton of CSS, a lot of people talk about the differences between structural and decorative when you're talking about the design on a page the difference between a box and a box shadow.  Would you say that color -- especially given your talk, would you say that color is more structural or decorative?
      >> Yeah.  Let's see.
      >> I've been thinking about this a lot to be fair.  I totally through it at you.
      >> No.  Structural.
      >> Yeah, I mean that's something I'm always wondering about.  But, yeah, your talk was amazing.
      >> It really depends on the context of the experience you're trying to provide.  I mean something that is academia and then color can be seen as information driven, for example.  But if you take it in the context of a game, for example, then it becomes decorative.  Like, it's -- it's a little bit extra that makes for a nice experience but not necessarily completely necessary such as, you know, a website that color equals CSS.  Like, red is CSS, blue is HTML, that's how you navigate between those, so illustration.  That's my answer.
      >> That was a good answer.  Can we give Ricardo another round of applause?
      >> Thank you.
      >> You guys want to hear more haikus?  Or did you read them all already online?  It's cool if you don't follow me on Twitter.  It's cool.  That's fine.  Okay.  Let's see.
      Oh, right before lunch too I'll slow some stickers up there.  If you have stickers that you want to give out to people, I know that's a really big currency thing in seeing that the New York stock exchange just imploded, we want we might want to use that as a form of currency.  You're stuck here, by the way.  These are your people, this is now your land.
      >> Text won't center.  Text style.  Left.  Align.  Float.  Margin.  I guess I'll add a DIV.  Do you remember before we had cascading style sheets?  Winter is long gone.
      This one is really poetic.  And who -- if this person is here, can I just give you a hug at some point because it's really good.
      CSS love is a DIV ID titanic with float to none.
      >> Too soon.
      >> Too soon?  What?  A couple more maybe.  Again, not ate solved problem.  You guys are engineers.  Why don't we solve the whole switching delay ports problem.  Not to put more pressure on you guys.  Sorry.
      CSS admits I have not slept in two days.  Sass still compiling.
      The dial-up thing really took me back.  Did that take you guys back?  Pretty good.
      Question raise your hand if that is a sound of pain for you?  Raise your hand if that's nostalgic.  Wow.  And you guys complain about CSS?
      You ready?
      >> We had a switch in the schedule.  So without further adieu, John Brown.
      >> I'm from the Pacific Northwest, I'm from a town called Portland, which you may know.
      >> Where is that exactly?
      >> It's in the United States, I don't know if we're still there.
      >> We are.  But barely.
      >> I drove here.  Who else drove?  Good.  I don't know why I said good.
      Was anybody stuck in Tacoma?  I was the only one?  That's ridiculous.  All right.  I'm ready to go.
      >> Rough life.
      >> Yeah.
      >> Hi, everybody.  My name is John Brown, and I'm from Portland.  This is all part of my intro that I just gave.  And I'm here to talk about art, and sort of my journey through CSS art, which I've taken relatively recently.  So what we're going to do today is talk about creative coding.  This goes by a lot of different names, creative coding, code art, expressive programming, general art -- basically it's the idea of making art with code using math.  And it's sort of becoming really a new field in CSS, and so I'm really excited to talk to you guys about this.
      When we talk about art, you want to make sure that the person talking to you is qualified.  So I want to show you that I am qualified like all great artists, I'm an art school dropout.  Two times.  I did just pay off all my student loans about a month ago, so that's great.
      So what we're going to be doing today is a lot of eye candy.  Stuff that looks like this.  Stuff that looks like this.  This is not my clicker.  I'm not used to it.  Stuff that look like this, stuff you saw from Gregor is very similar in exploring CSS and seeing visually what can be representative.  It's not what you can do, it's interesting.
      So there's going to be a lot of eye candy.  Zero usable code, so you guys can take back to your jobs and say this was worth it.  But there will be lots of usable ideas hopefully.  It will spark some things in your brain and maybe some conversations with some other people here, and that's what it's all about.  Conferences is communication and meeting new people and the communicate community that comes out of that.
      So why make art?  Learning is more fun when there's art.  If you have to learn how a box shadow works, isn't it more if you be when you believe it as opposed to making something visually appearing than making a website at work.  Way more fun to fill in on your own.
      And also there's this freedom that you get to do whatever you want.  If you want to explore box shadows in CSS or the animations or Z depth or Z index or whatever you want to do, you get that freedom because the art as yours.  And also there's different problems to solve with art.  You know, if you're going to put a bunch of things together and move, it's how is the transition moving and, like, is the, like, line weight that I'm using good or should I speed it up or slow it down, so these are things that we don't think about, or make a form accessibility function or accessibility functional.  Those are not, like, so using the art side of your brain is a good way to explore the other side of your brain that you're not using all the time.
      So I'm going to start from the top.  What I'm going to be talking to you guys about is a 100 day project.  Has anybody here heard of the 100 days project?  Yeah.  L luna started this idea of doing something every day for 100 days.  Small or large.  Learn to play guitar or talk to a stranger.  Do something fun, interesting that challenges yourself.  However you feel get in the habit.  So I wanted to do 100 pure CSS animations.  What I did was 82 pure CSS animations.
      Obviously there are days where I could just not find the time with work or travel.  So I'm really proud sticking through the whole 100 days, but I did miss a few days in there.  So the genesis of this idea sort of comes from a project that I worked on last year, which was the Google AO2014 experiment, and this was a project I was a lead developer on for a instrument where I work in Portland, Oregon.  And we did this whole experiment for Google.com for the IO conference where this is all done in CSS 3D.  Each one of these -- these are elements on a stage, and they move around in 3D space, and the reason we did this was we wanted to make something really interesting that would be available for mobile.  Because Web GL in 2014 wasn't really available on phones, except to a few androids.  We wanted to do something that was fun but could worked on mobile.  CSS 3T to the rescue.  Puts it on the GPU, it runs so well, you can check out this experiment now, and it runs on your phone as well as it does on a laptop.
      So just close all my browsers, that was a total idea.  If anybody in here uses divvy, I had to skip through it.
      Another really cool thing while we're doing, I got a lot of really good inspiration from Anna who gave a talk at CSS conf 2013, all 3D really would cool polyhedrons, if you're interested in the math side of CSS and match up with art, you should absolutely check out her talk and while you're browsing around on YouTube, you can also check out the talk I gave the next year that goes onto all about the IO experiment that I just showed you.  It's really cool, it's open source, like, the framework we built, and you guys can check it out.
      So here's some ground rules for this project, the 100 day project that I did.  One obviously JavaScript.  Two this is harder.  No SVGs, it has to move.  I really like motion, so I wanted to make something that would usually loop over time that you could throw up on a screen and just watch and enjoy and consume it.
      There was another really interesting piece, like, a constraint, which was every day I would only have one DIV, or I would add another DIV to the list.  And child and figure things out mathematically on a chain.  And the reason I put these constraints on myself, when you're making art, you're essentially looking at a blank canvas, and if you don't have any direction, that canvas can be really intimidating.  If you think about all the different art in your life, that's terrifying.  So you want to figure out some constraints to put on yourself to work in a direction.  So this is mine that I put on myself.  So day one I had one DIV, day two I had two, day 100 I had 100.  Complicated to keep track of.  Really -- this made my life a lot better on day and a whole lot of Sass.  Sass is amazing, it gives you sine and cosine, and you can do really fun animations, really amazing, not would have been possible.  Sass.
      So let's get to it.  That's a lot of preamble for the actual main event.  100 days of D IVs.  So I did this.  I blew up my social media forever, every day posting one of these.  Most of them were basically from scratch.  But they were all interesting and some things iterated and grew on each other.  Some days were geometric, and they had, like, really solid, like, lines and estate.  Sometimes I got a little weird, a little bit more organic.  Again, these are all CSS 3D, and they break the idea of what is the geometry, the quad that we're used to.  Some of them got real weird.  Some days I didn't know what to do, so I started throwing things at a wall, but I really like the output for some of those.
      Some days were crap, day two, give me a break.  But the point is to just do it every day no matter how you feel, just put it up there and make something.  It's fun, and it's interesting and get into the rhythm.
      I don't have the thing that tells me what my next slide is.  Oh, let's give a status report.  So 100 days of ND IVs.  Was it fun?  Totally fun.  Would I do it again?  No.  At least not with this particular constraint that I gave myself.  I really -- I started doing some really fun 3D things.  But realized I was basically recreating matrix geometry just because couldn't be nested.  There were things I wanted to explore that I couldn't.  So I wouldn't do this particular thing again, but I will definitely be making CSS animations.  And should you try it, that's the question.  Maybe.
      So there's a lot of good reasons to make art in CSS.  And I want to go over those.  I think everybody in this room should be making art.  But some lean more toward JavaScript because that's what they're comfortable with, some lean more toward CSS, we're going to talk about CSS because it's CascadiaCSS here.  So reasons to make art and CSS in particular.  You already know it.  You're already using it every day.  So you sort of understand the syntax.  You can do it anywhere.  This is fun, like, if you want to do canvas artwork with JavaScript, you sort of have to make a camera instance, new JavaScript, file, you have to sort of, like, break whatever you're doing.  But if you want to make art with CSS, you can be literally sitting at work and be, like, you know, I'm going to make this thing bounce.  I'm going to make this thing into crazy rainbows.  So at any moment you can break out of what you're doing and break out in art.  Obviously don't check that into GitHub, but it's definitely you can do.
      And also CSS is discrete objects, so anything in here done something with JavaScript or canvas or processing, or most ways of making art with code, you're redrawing the square on every frame so you draw a square and then you say, like, keep track of that XY and here's a center point and draw another square, and it layers things on top of each other.  So you have to control the buffer and clearing the canvas, and it can be really messy and there's a lot of boilerplate.  But with CSS, you just transition and move it around.  So these discrete objects that can live in the canvas that you're making with CSS, so it's super powerful and prevents a lot of clean up.  And that's -- oh -- it has pretty deviant 3D.  You can nest things, again, I'm mentioning Gregor more than I'm mentioning myself, but you can see that you can nest things and make them 3D and made it really, really cool, and it kicks into the GPU, so it makes it super perform ant, and you don't have to worry about chugging your computer down.
      And you also get to learn a craft in a very interesting way.  So reading the docs and figuring out how to animate it and how you can push it in a different direction is a great way to learn the things you already know.  So that way when someone comes to you with a question, you can go, oh, I know exactly how that works because I broke it earlier, and here's how to make actually work.
      Also CSS is really interesting.  A lot of people when I've talked to them about it, like, what are you going to do with CSS?  It's just going to live in the browser and that's it.  I have an example where it tan sent the a people.  I was in the middle of this project, and I got invited to be a part of an art show that the oil be paintings and sculptures and 3D printed things and I made a piece with CSS, and the only piece of CSS artwork, it was in a gallery show, got put into a book, and there's this moment for me I realized no matter what you're doing with your code and mashing it up with art, there's always an output for it.  Whether it's a projection on a wall or just your screen or print medium, there's always a reason to be making art that be transcend you sitting in a room, more importantly you can put it on the Internet and share with 7 billion people.  That's really great.
      One thing had to neat under oath while I was working on my CSS stuff.  You can go check it out, my slides are online you can check out what I'm showing you already.  If you do go check it out, notice I did browser testing and optimization, I think this graph is misleading.  There it is.  Sorry it was black, at the very bottom.  I should have made that a different color.  Basically I explored the -- I didn't do any cross browser testing.  If it worked in Chrome, awesome, I didn't worry about IE5 through 11.  Optimization, my computer hates me now.  It was so hot so many days where I was just pushing these things around.  If it worked for me on my really fancy laptop, that was good enough for me.  It was all about doing something every day for 30 minutes and hoping some people around the world could see it.  And I understand some people could not, and that's just the part of creating.
      So I'm going to get you to the three Cs of creative coding.  Anybody that knows me loves literation.
      Three Cs.  Copy.  Change.  And chance.
      So copy.  Anyone you talk to they say how they got started was copying someone else.  Whether they're an artist and tracing the Sunday comics.  If you want to get into art, it's more than just being an artist, you have to start your way at the bottom and work your way up.  And that's fine.  Copying is totally fine.  Changing the idea that you like and never settling, always pushing it, look at Gregor with all his fractals, he discovered it, he's, like, this is amazing, I'm going to push it in all these different ways.  Keep pushing and changing things that are new and different and pushing yourself.  And also the chance.  Happy accidents are all over the place with code art.  It's pretty amazing.  I'll show you a couple.  But there's always this idea you're accidentally inverting a number you're putting sine instead of cosine, and it inverts it, changing it, and makes it a whole new piece.  Basically a fork, I'm going to walk down this road, happy chance, it's all over the place with code art.
      So an example of copy.  I really shouldn't have done this on the stage.  Because I have me one second.  I'm so sorry.  I hate this.  So hold on.
      I'm going to do some live demos, and this is going to be scary.  Okay.  So here we are.  Here we go.
      Okay.  So you -- just going to put that right down over here.
      [Laughter]
      So the idea -- go back.  So the idea of copying totally fine.  So this is my Tiffany race sign, so this got bubbled up onto the front page of code pen, and I saw this one day while doing my project and I was, like, this is really cool.  I don't want to play with this idea of rotation and off center and layering it and really fun.  So she did hers in canvas, and I ended up copying it basically.  Doing it all in CSS.  And it was fun, like, I sort of had a path that I could walk down.  I could play with it, figure out how it worked, boom.  Copy.  Done.  The idea now that I can take this, learn about off center rotation, miss idea of layering those circles, walk down another path, learn something different.
      Change.  I came up with this idea, this idea, this is a little bit serendipity right here, but this is box shadows, and animating over time, and it gives this really fun parentally feel.  And then a couple days later I went back and sort of explored the same box shadow animation idea over time, and ended up with this.  So it's -- essentially the same code base but basically explored in a different way and just trying out a bunch of different things.  So copy, change, chance, this is a fun one.  I was laying in bed working on my project.  I had this -- I was, like, oh, cool.  I really like this circle thing that I got here.  And then I ended up -- I was trying to type a different number.  I think I was trying to center this in a different way.  So there's this ten-year, can I zoom in?  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, I'm actually looking at it here.
      So this radius ten.  What happens when I accidentally turn that into a one?  This.  It just pops out.  I saw this I was, like, okay.  Cool.  Project done.  Day done.  Like, I didn't need to explore it anymore.  That moment made it so much more fun and visually interesting and three-dimensional that, like, it was actually kind of a shocking moment, and I put it aside to talk about it with other people later.  So this idea of just accidentally changing an equation or inverting a number or changing a factor or something is amazing.
      Leave this page.
      There's another C that I didn't tell you about.  Combine.  So this is the fourth C of creative code.  But it's basically the idea of taking all three copy, change, and chance, putting them together, using them in the same way.  So this is Charley Deck.  He does a lot of really great processing sketches, this is a processing sketch, and I saw it and I love the movement and the gradients, so I decided I want to copy it, change it, and hopefully there will be a chance to make it interesting.  So I ended up coming up with on day ten this thing, this wavy guy, so essentially I can come in here, change the number of waves, make the amplitude a little bit less, change that, change the waves to six, and we'll just call that good just for, like, a Democrat on he.
      So essentially this is what you guys just saw but, you know, copied, changed a little bit, put into more of a longer, flat idea, and I had a great time doing that.  Leave this page.
      And then so that's day ten.  Day 36 rolls around, I decided I'm going to go back and try to explore that idea a little bit more.  So I started, like, pulling out this idea of this wave, so this is what I had.  Day 36, so I decided, like, start playing with how these things are layered, offset, animated.  Came up with this.  I was, like, this is all right.  But it's not exactly what I'm looking for today on day 36.  So I put it aside, came back 50 -- 20 days, I came back on day 56 and started coming in here, playing with some of these pieces.  And normally what I would have done was copy -- you guys are hungry.  I can hear it.  I can hear a bunch of rumbling tummies.
      I built this, and I don't know where anything is in it.  We're going to put this in the oven baking show style.  We're going to say cool and ended up with this.  And basically.
      [Laughter]
      Through a little bit -- I sort of inverted a number and ended up with this ribbony effect.  This is it.  Again, you can check these out, these are all going to be up online.
      So this fourth C, this combine of taking all these different pieces and putting them together and really exploring having a great time.  So that's it.  That's the four Cs.  We're going to get out of here, except for one last section as you can see.  The swear word that you have been curious what this is.  Who has seen me talk and know what the swear word is?  Yell it.  Oh, common.  Talk is homework.  This is a swear word amongst a lot of people.  So we're talking about a little bit of homework.  Art.  I want you guys to go make art.  And here are some really easy options of how to get started in there.  These are quick and simple, maybe two hours of your time at most.  Do them this weekend, next week, let me know, I would love to know that you're doing this.  First one is -- this is easy.  You've got a lot of really good options on code pen, they bubble things up to surface, fork them, change them, explore them, look at my stuff, look at Gregor's stuff, go in there, find something you like visually, explore it, change it, get into it.
      Option number two.  If you're from Portland or within Portlandish area, you should come do Portland creative coders.  I coordinate a group of coders where we get together all the time and do workshops and jam sessions where we're making weird, fun stuff with code with no other purposes than making fun, weird, stuff with coding.  You should definitely come to it.  Just look for it online.  Or if you're not from Portland, go to a meet up, a code meet up, go to a CSS or JavaScript, talk about code and art.  Look around the room, these are your people.  Everybody that is paying attention, these are people that you are that you can talk to about this stuff.
      Or just create a group, do what I did, find some really fun people, build a community around it.  All right.  I have one minute left.  Option number three.  I'm launching a new side project today.  Rugs ready?  I have a lot of side projects, but this is my newest, latest, greatest one.  It's called a lonely square.  What does that mean.
      A lonely square is this idea of a one square, black square, surrounded by a field of white.  And this square can do anything it wants as long as it returns to the single black field of white.  What does it look like?  It doesn't look like that.  That's a terrible example.
      So it's this idea where you take this black square, animate it, change it, form it, do whatever you want, but then have it come back.  And the idea is you're all going to make this stuff.  We're going to string it all together.  It's -- there's a website up for it right now.  You're going to hashtag it, I'm going to download it, we're going to put it all together in this streaming loop of really fun code animations, and that's it.  We're going to make a really fun project together.  So I'm launching this today.  On anybody knows about this except for you guys in this room, a lonely square.  Hopeful you guys make something cool, and we can put it all together.  Thank you, guys, very much.  I'm John Brown, this is where you can find the slides, and let's go eat some lunch.
      [clapping]
      Do you want to talk to me?
      >> Not so fast.  You can't leave yet.  We have a few more announcements and then I want to talk to Mr. John Brown a little bit.  You'll have so much time to eat.  Don't worry about it.  Sorry we're running late, that's a conference thing; right?  So you are the second speaker from Portland.  Do you have beef with the coffee suggestion that Amy made?  Do you want to throw a different coffee shop into the mix?
      >> I roast my own coffee every three days -- this is the most Portland thing you're going to hear.  Grind it within 30 seconds of pouring water on it.  Make a single cup at a time for my wife and myself every morning.  And I weigh everything and I know exactly how much cream and sugar in it.  So all coffee is inferior to me basically.
      >> Whoa.
      >> That was the snobbiest thing I've ever said.
      >> A real programmer speak over here.
      >> That's the only thing I'm snobby about.
      >> Is color a concept?
      >> Oh.
      >> Is it structural or decorative?
      >> It's everything.
      >> Color is everything.
      >> You heard it here first.
      >> Except for monochromatic, just black and white --
      >> It's the absence of color; right?
      >> Actually if you're going to go past white or past black or combining colors.
      >> Keep talking.
      >> It got real --
      >> Like I said I dropped out of art school twice, so I don't know.
      >> That's awesome.  Cool do you want to read, can we read, like, two haikus?
      >> I would love to.
      >> Has anyone seen dramatic Yelp readings?
      >> Should we do dramatic haikus?
      >> We can.  We can do whatever we want.
      >> More titanic haikus, everybody.
      >> So good.  I particularly tried to find the more art specific ones.
      >> Cool.  We'll see how you did.
      >> Okay.
      >> I'm going to talk in a boat.  D IVs softly floating.  Damn it forget the shorthand again.
      Child shifting nest, shapes, conserving corns, designs.
      That was a good one.  You do the last one.
      >> Okay.
      >> Did you just take screen shots of these?
      >> I did, yeah.  The ones that I wanted to -- I retweeted every single one of them, so otherwise it would be a little bit of a mess.  But I've been known to be that also.  Thanks for the laugh.  You're my favorite.  No matter what people say about you.  Just kidding.
      >> I think you're great too.
      >> No.  I can't find another one.
      >> She's going through cat photos, and vacation pictures, you went way too fast.
      >> Way too far.
      >> Just got lost in your photos.
      >> John Brown, you have the most American name.
      >> I know.
      >> I have ever heard.
      >> Here's the deal.  I have a bad SEO problem, John Brown, that's where I am everywhere.  This is John Brown, that's how you find me.
      >> And a lonely square; right?
      >> And a lonely square.
      >> Is this okay for people to tweet about it?
      >> Yeah.  I'm launching it now, but it's not exclusively to this room.
      >> Cool.  Cool.
      >> A lonely square.  I'll say it one more time.
      >> Okay.  So Tracy's going to do a little bit of announcing, and then I will return after the lunch break.
      >> All right.  I promise this is going to be so quick.  I know you guys are very, very hungry.  So we just want to continue to encourage you to register if you haven't already.  As of dinnertime, they will be checking for wristbands, but go bananas at lunch.  And to caution with lunch with his there's a lot of amazing food.  Camilla is one of our volunteers, she's going to be walking around the buffets themselves.  If you have any questions about ingredients or if you have a concern, Camilla will help you as well as any of the staff members of the resort.  They're wearing all black and have name tags.  So if you have a concern, let them know.
      The final thing, it's that quick, is we're going to be coming back because of the time change we still want to make sure y'all get a full hour of lunch in just relaxing and sun.  So I believe it's -- is it 1:25 right now?  1:30?  We'll collect back here for layer 10S, which is going to be so much fun at 2:30 so go eat.
