Have you made your travel plans for CascadiaJS yet? Hacker Train is back and it's going to be our biggest yet! 

We have multiple train cars reserved so that our Cascadian folk are able to nerd out, wifi it up, hack, nosh, and make some new friends as we arrive in perfect time to get settled for the conference.

The train departs from multiple PNW cities on Tuesday, July 7th: 

* **Portland**: 2:40pm from the Amtrak Union Station. Meet the group no later than 2:10pm.
* **Seattle**: 6:50pm from the Amtrak King Street Station in downtown Seattle. Meet the group no later than 6:20pm
* **Vancouver, BC**: 5:35pm from the Amtrak Pacific Central Station. Meet the group no later than 5:05pm with passport in-hand.

*Plan to arrive at the station no later than 30 minutes prior to departure. Your captain will be waiting along with your group. The group is only allowed to board when all are present.*

After you've registered, we'll get in contact to coordinate our group departure and introduce the captains. We'll also coordinate some optional social activities for the ride.

**This is a one-way trip and you are responsible for your return trip.**

#### Friends flying into Seattle who would like to ride the Hacker Train:

Plan for your flight to arrive before 5pm for a large window of safety to catch the light rail from SeaTac airport to the King Street Station using the [Link Light Rail](http://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/central-link-light-rail).
This connection to Hacker Train costs less than $3. Tickets are sold from a vending machine on the rail platform that accepts cash, Visa, or Mastercard.

All Hacker Train attendees will hop on a shuttle upon arrival to Bellingham to be whisked off to the resort!
