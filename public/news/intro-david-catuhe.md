David Catuhe - a self-professed "3D addict since the prehistoric age of computing" will show us how to do awesome 3D with nothing more than a modern browser! David has kindly agreed to answer a few questions for us:

*As a Cascadian, what's your favorite local activity?*
> Foooooooood! And mainly cheeses. :)

*What does your usual work day look like?*
> Developing with JS and discussing with both JS developers and developers of JS (Chakra in this case :) ).

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*
> Browsers developers and JS community. I've been developing since more than 30 years ago, but I can see so many wonders as a developer in the last 3 years and mostly in the web space.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*
> I was a C++ developer and then a C# developer (mostly in 3D development).

*What does your dream job look like?*
> Creating a tool that others developers love to use.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*
> I'm a Magic The Gathering collector

*Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?*
> I'm a Babylon 5 SUPER FAN!
