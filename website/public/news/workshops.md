## The Workshop Track

We are excited to announce that this year we are working with some wonderful companies and organizations to offer the first-ever Workshop Track at CascadiaFest. With 3 days of talks partitioned into 3 major categories of web development skills (front-end design/CSS, client-side JS and server-side JS) we felt like now was the right time to offer an alternative for people who want to do some hands-on learning. 

Unless otherwise noted, all of the workshops are FREE and are included in your conference pass. All of the workshops have capacity limits, so please make sure to RSVP as soon as possible.
