Rachel Nabors is an interaction developer and web animation expert from Portland, OR. She'll be speaking at CascadiaCSS about the place of animation in user experience. Rachel kindly answered a few of our questions to help get to know her better:

*What's a good Twitter-length description of your talk?*

> Animation's taking its place in the web dev toolbox. But when and why should you use it? Rachel Nabors lays down the rules.

*As a Cascadian, do you have any recommendations for out of towners while they're here?*

> Pick up a bird identification guide.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> USUAL? Well, I've two kinds of workdays: at home and abroad. If I'm at home, I make a gaiwan pot of my favorite oolong tea and begin by going over the European web dev tweets in my home office's Comic Book Nook. Then I move to my IKEA-hack standing desk and get to coding and designing. If I need to write, it's another pot of tea and the kitchen table.

> If I'm abroad, my work day starts on the plane or the train. I carry a digital drawing tablet in addition to my laptop so I can do any art tasks while on the move. But I also make lots of room for experiencing the trip. You have a set limit on the number hours you get to spend here. It's important to not stuff them all full of staring at screens. Remember to be alive. Be human.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> Sara Souiedan for her methodical work with SVG. Nicky Case is a rising star in interaction development with his "explorable explanations." Storytelling and interaction at their finest. So there you have it: Science and art, Sarah and Nicky.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> Yes, I was an award-winning cartoonist before I left comics for the web in 2008. I had many teenage girl fans. I wanted to found a comics publishing company just for that market. Little did I realize print was the wrong direction for the time! My comics got all their loving online.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> What I'm doing now: make neat things, help people, share, teach, travel. One day I'm sure I'll need to Get Serious!

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*

> I'm a wannabe ornithologist: I'm always geeking out at aviaries and bird watching spots. I have a bit of a green thumb, too: my pet orchids are almost always in bloom. They make me happy.
