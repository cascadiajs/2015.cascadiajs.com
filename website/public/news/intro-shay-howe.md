Shay Howe is a designer and front-end developer at [Belly](https://www.bellycard.com/) in Chicago, IL. He'll be speaking at CascadiaCSS about sharing modular HTML and CSS components through a service-based architecture. Shay kindly answered a few of our questions to help get to know him better:

*What's a good Twitter-length description of your talk?*

> Learn how to structure and write modular HTML and CSS, and reuse those styles across multiple websites.

*Is this your first trip to the Pacific Northwest? Do you have other plans for your trip?*

> Thankfully this won’t be my first trip to the Pacific Northwest. I’ve been to Portland, one of my all time favorite cities, a few times and try to make it out there every year or two. That said, I’ve never been to Washington and am really looking forward to it! I’ve also never been to Vancouver and am hoping to spend a few days there at the beginning or end of my trip.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> One of my favorite parts of my job is that I don’t typically have a usual or normal day. Generally, most mornings start with catching up on emails and some reading but from there one of many things can happen. Somedays I’m jumping straight into writing code for a given product or our front-end framework. Other days I’m more focused on product and design, be it by way of talking with our users or stakeholders, sketching, prototyping, or visual design. I also spend quite a bit of time working with different teams, such as account management, operations, sales, and so forth, making sure we’re all on the same page and pushing our products forward.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> Pinpointing one specific individual within our industry who consistently blows me away is difficult, there are so many people doing amazing work. What I can say is, I’m always motivated by those who are solving the problems they truly care about. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fantastic tools but are only useful in a larger context. Watching someone use them to bring new ideas and solutions to problems close to them is always exciting.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> In high school I worked for a local television station as a floor director for the news and edited a few local commercials and shows. As for jobs go, it was awesome and served as a great introduction to different digital mediums. I was also in a band for a while, although I’m not sure it counted as a job.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> Honestly, I have it. Confucius once said “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.” and I am beyond fortunate. I love what I do!

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*

> When I’m not behind a computer I do my best to spend as much time outdoors as possible. Living in Chicago, IL that isn’t as easy said as done some days. Given the right weather you can find me in a forest on a mountain bike or on a lake fishing.
