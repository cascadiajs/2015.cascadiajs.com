At CascadiaJS: Browser Day, Ben Straub is going What happens when a Coffeescript-powered robot becomes a member of your development team or your HR team. He's provided the following answers to our "getting to know you" questions:

*As a Cascadian, do you have any recommendations for out of towners while they’re here?*

> Hiking and exploring.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> It's pretty simple. I take my coffee downstairs (I work from home), plug into my work environment, turn on some music, triage some things, go to a stand-up meeting over a hangout, focus work until lunchtime, then back to the basement with tea for more coding until the kids are done with school. 

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> Tim Pope. If you've used VIM for any length of time, you'll know who this is. He wrote about half of the plugins in my .vim folder, and it's amazing how many hits he's got.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> My entire professional life has been writing software, but before that I worked in fast food and at a grocery store. I've written non-web software, too, like Windows device drivers, and software for barcode scanners.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> Doing interesting, rewarding work, with great coworkers and while earning enough to keep my family safe and fed, and with enough money, spare time, and flexibility to go adventuring. Hey, that sounds like my current job!

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*

> Our family likes to go on adventures of all sorts. We hike, travel, eat new foods – anything that makes our lives more interesting.
