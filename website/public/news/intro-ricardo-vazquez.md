Ricardo Vazquez is a UI/UX Designer at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/). He&rsquo;ll be speaking at CascadiaCSS about delighting users with microinteractions. Ricardo kindly answered a few of our questions to help get to know him better:

*What&rsquo;s a good Twitter-length description of your talk?*

> We&rsquo;ll explore the nuances of microinteractions and emotional delight by asking &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the smallest thing I can affect?&rdquo;

*Is this your first trip to the Pacific Northwest? Do you have other plans for your trip?*

> This is my first time in the state of Washington, but I have come to know and love the Pacific Northwest from its Canadian counterpart, British Columbia. The nature and beautiful scenery make this place of the world hard to leave. I can&rsquo;t wait to view the Olympic Mountains close up, and enjoy the breath-taking Semiahmoo Resort. Of course, I have planned to catch up with industry friends I see on special occasions such as CascadiaFest.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> I&rsquo;m an early bird. I like getting into the office early, as morning time is usually when I am most productive. I will grab some breakfast, a cup of coffee, and get started on the day&rsquo;s adventures. I work in a highly multidisciplinary and creative team. As such, I perform a combination of design and code. When coding, I like focusing on little details, making the front-end design as crisp as it can be. When designing, I concentrate my efforts on User Interface Design. Designing mobile apps is where you&rsquo;ll find me happiest. Yes, a full day&rsquo;s work wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a solid couple of afternoon ping pong games.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> Ever since I discovered him on [The Manual](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/), [Frank Chimero](http://frankchimero.com/)&rsquo;s words constantly resound within me. I can&rsquo;t get enough of him. I use his writing as personal manifestos of my work and design philosophy.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> I love teaching, which is why I endeavored into joining the education industry. I am a part-time Faculty at a College near where I live. I teach coding infused with human-centred Design principles to eager students. I also teach Design seminars to University and College Design programs.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> My dream job will allow me to do a combination of the things I love. This is what my day would look like:
>
> - 4:30am: Wake up!
> - 5:00am - 6:00am: Be one with the boat. Rowing.
> - 7:30am - 12:00pm: Design the world away.
> - 1:00pm - 3:00pm: Teach a design class.
> - 3:00 - 4:00pm: Writing
> - 4:00pm - onwards: Be with the ones I love.
>
> I’m getting there :)

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn&rsquo;t on a computer?*

> [I love rowing](https://medium.com/@iamrvazquez/you-can-quit-tomorrow-5bdce3bf56d). I started during my first year in university and have kept it since. Rowing allows me to find stillness and focus on the sound of water rushing through me. I also play classical guitar. When I work from home, l pick up the guitar to step away from the computer while a design problem or coding challenge arises. Playing the guitar has the ability to organize my mind, and structure a new course of action. If I’m not doing any of the latter, I enjoy spending time outdoors; breathing in some fresh air ziplining or hiking through a trail.
