				<p>We are inviting the JavaScript <a href="link to browser day CFP">

				and <a href="link to CSS day CFP">CSS</a> communities to submit
				talks for CJSFest 2015 in the <a href="link to venue/lodging section">Semiahoo Resort</a>. This Call for Proposals will close on
				March 15th.</p>

				<p>Diversity of voices is important to our Cascadian community,
				so please don't think that you need to be a tech celebrity in
				order to speak at CJSFest. Please let us know in your proposal
				submission if your company is able to pay your travel & hotel.
				It’s a huge help to keep costs manageable for our community-run
				conference. The deadline to submit a proposal is March 15th,
				2015 11:59pm UTC-1200. If it's still March 15th, no matter where
				you are in the world, you still have time!</p>
