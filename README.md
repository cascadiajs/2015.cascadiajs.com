## New Structure

This year we are going to experiment with a new format for CJS. In the past CJS was a 2-day, 1-track conference that covered the gamut of JavaScript. In 2015, we are going to break down the event into 3 distinct days:

* CSS Day (UX)
* BrowserJS Day
* ServerJS Day

The entire event will be called Cascadia JSFest and will share infrastructure such as the event space, hotel, etc. As an attendee you'll have the option of purchasing a ticket to a single event or a bundle that includes entry to all of them. All-access tickets will be a priority in release and single events and lodging days will be announced closer to the event.
