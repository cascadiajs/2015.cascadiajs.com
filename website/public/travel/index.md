# Getting to and from the Cascadia&nbsp;funtimes

### Planes & Trains

Blaine is a beautiful departure from some of our larger Cascadian tech city centers. The closest airport is Bellingham International Airport. If you are traveling by air,we recommend flying into Seattle's SeaTac airport, catching the light rail to the King Street Station using the [Link Light Rail](//www.soundtransit.org/schedules/central-link-light-rail), and hopping the [Hacker Train](/travel/hackertrain) with your fellow Cascadian friends. Hacker Train tickets are still available! The Link connection to Hacker Train costs less than $3. Tickets are sold from a vending machine on the rail platform that accepts cash, Visa, or Mastercard.

If you're unable to make the Hacker Train departure, [Amtrak](//amtrak.com) provides a few options to getting you to your destination at Bellingham Amtrak Station(BEL).

### Busses

In addition, bus service to and from Bellingham is available via either [BoltBus](//www.boltbus.com) or [GreyHound](//www.greyhound.com).

### Cabs

While Bellingham and Blaine do not have an Uber presence, these cities do have plenty of well-recommended cab companies: [Rommel's Taxis](//www.yellowpages.com/bellingham-wa/mip/rommels-taxi-474134936) can be reached via phone at [1 (360) 510-1177](tel:13605101177) or [Your Cab Company](http://yourcabco.com/) at [1 (360) 746-4943](tel:13607464943) and are usually very responsive.

As part of wanting to make sure all of our attendees make it to and from the events with as little stress as possible, we will be providing shuttles to the Semiahmoo Resort to and from the Amtrak station as well as the listed alternative lodging.
