Jeff Lembeck is a developer at [npm, inc.](https://www.npmjs.com/) and a full-on coffee-roasting Seattleite. He'll be speaking at CascadiaCSS about using design principles to create great developer tools. Jeff kindly answered a few of our questions to help get to know him better:

*What’s a good Twitter-length description of your talk?*

> Making developer-focused tools is hard. Get better at it with this set
of not so weird tips.

*As a Cascadian, do you have any recommendations for out of towners while they’re here?*

> Make this as long of a trip as possible. Rent a car and drive to Mt.
Rainier and go to Paradise. Take another trip out to the coast and go
spend a night on the campgrounds in La Push. Staying extra time in
Seattle? Eat. Eat. Eat.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> I’m a very early riser, so my day normally starts at roughly 4:30am. I
keep a few different work lists - a year, month, week, day kind of
planning scheme where I put different tasks in different lists based
on where they should be, priority-wise. I plan out my day based on
those then kick into email to make sure nothing is on fire. After that
I get in another couple of hours of work and take a break for
breakfast. I’ll check in with coworkers at this point to see if
there’s anything I should be prioritizing then head back in for the
rest of the day, normally trying to end around 3pm so I can go play
with my daughter for a couple of hours before my wife gets home and we
start making dinner.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> The folks at Filament Group are friggin Aces and anybody would be
lucky to have that crew to bounce ideas off of.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> Four years at McDs, another four hocking cell phones (via Radio Shack)
— spent a little time in the shipping industry (read: 4am shift
loading boxes in the backs of trucks at UPS) and even worked as intern
at a banking company. I very much like what I do right now and I’m
never going back.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> Can I be the professional burrito eater on a hot tub boat sailing
team? I want to do that for a living.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn’t on a computer?*

> I roast my own coffee. I make an insane negroni. Otherwise, I spend
any sunny day I can outside with my wife and baby daughter.
