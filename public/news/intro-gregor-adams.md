Gregor Adams is a front-end developer and architect at [SINNERSCHRADER](https://sinnerschrader.com/) in Munich, Germany. He'll be speaking at CascadiaCSS about building fractals with CSS. Gregor kindly answered a few of our questions to help get to know him better:

*What's a good Twitter-length description of your talk?*

> In this talk you will learn about fractals and different techniques to generate them in CSS. Prepare to be amazed by some awesome examples.

*Is this your first trip to the Pacific Northwest? Do you have other plans for your trip?*

> I lived in the States for two years as a young teenager and traveled around the Westcoast for an entire summer but I'm pretty sure a lot has changed in the last 20 years ...(has it already been that long... getting old here). The week before the conference I will visit a friend in Seattle and catch some Washington-spirit. I'm taking this occasion and combining it with a relaxed and inspirational vacation.

*What does your usual work day look like?*

> My daily work differs from what I do when experimenting with CSS. I develop webpages and applications for "normal" customers like car-companies, travel-agencies or online markets. It is very commercial and generally boring compared to my standards, so I try to focus on architecture and spice up my workday with the latest technologies. I teach a lot of newcomers and younger developers which is probably the best about my current work.

*Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?*

> I am obviously amazed by the works of Ana Tudor and the way how she combines math with CSS. But there are other people that I respect for their amazing work. Hugo Giraudel with his advanced Sass skills, Sara Soueidan with her very usable and educational publications. I am very active on CodePen which is a great source to find awesome and inspirational input. To name just a few great artists I met on Codepen:

> - [http://codepen.io/cathbailh/](http://codepen.io/cathbailh/) (real name unknown)
>   - She constantly blows my mind with her remixes. The most artistic developer I have seen so far.
> - [http://codepen.io/natewiley/](http://codepen.io/natewiley/) (Nate Wiley)
>   - He does very amazing and colorful CSS animations, generates particles and creates canvas-like experiences in CSS
> - [http://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/](http://codepen.io/tmrDevelops/) (Tiffany Rayside)
>   - She does some really nice interactive canvas experiments. Works like hers sometimes make me wonder why I am so fixed on CSS.

*Have you worked in industries other than the web?*

> I am actually a trained hairdresser and worked in that field for over 10 years. People say I was really good at it and even back then I used to go on stage and was once even nominated as "germanys best hairdresser". Teaching others was also a very big thing back then. I worked as a trainer and focused on advanced coloring techniques and men-cuts. A few years ago I started programming and I think I took some of my "people skills" from my old job. I have had my ups and downs and probably one of the most awkward career turns you can imagine. My history is something I sometimes regret because I have missed so many years of active development but then I say to myself: "you are what you are, because you do what you do, you became what you became, because you did what you did". I am very happy with my life and career right now, so I guess I did in fact choose an awkwardly amazing path.

*What does your dream job look like?*

> In my dream job I teach others and only that. I could do that for the rest of my life. My experiments are something I consider art and I think I want to keep spending my free time with that. My job is already my hobby, that is why I changed my field of work a few years ago. Teaching others is more than just giving a helping hand. I like to twist the mind of others to cause that spark that will change the way they think. I am an autodidact and didn't have a mentor to teach me those things. This also means that my expectations are very high. When working with students I am often told that I bloom of excitement and while I can be a tough teacher, I try to take as much time as possible to help the people that are still trying to find that special knob in their mind.

*Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?*

> I am amazed by art but sadly don't have the space to really express myself in that hobby. Though I started very young and had my first artwork at a professional exposition at the age of seven.

> In my free time I like to do music. My room is filled with old synthesizers and I love playing with them and creating soundscapes or jamming with friends. At the moment I am actually more of a collector that a musician and music has become more of something that I like to enjoy while relaxing. I try to spend more and more of my life with spiritual journeys through my mind to find my "calm".
